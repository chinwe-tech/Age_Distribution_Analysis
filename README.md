# 📊 Age Distribution Analysis

This project explores the **age distribution of customers** using a histogram.  
The visualization helps us understand which age groups dominate the dataset, which is critical for **customer segmentation and targeted marketing**.  

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of customer ages.  
- Identify the most common age ranges.  
- Highlight underrepresented age groups.  
- Support data-driven decisions for marketing and product strategies.

### Histogram: Customer Age Distribution
![Age Histogram(]<img width="1130" height="747" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-30 163323" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bf500a6-450b-459e-bef0-11ab62ac1ffa" />)


- **X-Axis:** Age bins (0–20, 21–40, 41–60)  
- **Y-Axis:** Count of customers within each age range  
- **Bars:** Represent the frequency of customers in each age group  

---

## 🔎 Insights
- The **21–40 age group** has the **highest number of customers (~55)**, indicating the core target demographic.  
- The **41–60 age group** follows closely (~50 customers), showing a strong secondary market.  
- The **0–20 age group** is very small (~9 customers), meaning younger audiences are underrepresented in this dataset.  

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
- Businesses should focus primarily on **young to middle-aged adults (21–40)** while maintaining engagement with **older adults (41–60)**.  
- Further research is needed to determine why **teenagers/young adults (<20)** are less represented.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau / Excel** for visualization  
- **Histogram chart** for distribution analysis  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Segment age groups further (e.g., 21–30, 31–40, etc.) for more precision.  
- Cross-analyze age groups with **purchase behavior** to see which group drives the most revenue.  
- Use insights to design **personalized campaigns** for different age categories.
